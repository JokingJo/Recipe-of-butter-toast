    <h1> Wackiest Recipes</h1>
    <p>In order to become <strong><em>successful</em></strong> you need to embrace a life of pain/minimalism.
This mean that you can't waste time making foods that are enjoyable. No. That would distract you from your true purpose. You need to suffer and more importantly show others that you are suffering.
The recipes below are designed to help you to be successful.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>They are simple so as not to waste time</li>
        <li>They do not have good nutrition value, specifically protein. Remember you want others to see you suffering and wasting away. You need your body to start converting its protein tissue into go-go juice ie Neurotransmitters</li>
        <li>They are marketed as Wack and kinda of, are. This is so that you have lingo (Another cool word) that you can utilise that will make you mysterious but also really show others that you are suffering...mentally</li>
    </ol>    
    <h2>Recipes</h2>

    <p>Remember to take it to the next level by playing eye of the tiger while preparing these meals and try to punch the air repeatedly at intermittent intervals to throw people off</p>
        <p> If people stare at you or your food weirdly just remember they are haters and are jelly of you</p>
